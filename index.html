        <h3>Best Starting Areas In Games
        </h3>
        <ol>
        0. Central Yharnam - Bloodborne <br>  
            <img src="https://cdn1.lockerdome.com/uploads/83fcf41306fe20e4172311a3d351896c4df5df2c62570405bc970146e8d34775_:original">
            <p>Central Yharnam is an interconnected Souls masterpiece. It constantly loops back on itself, slowly unlocking shortcuts and easier paths through the level. It also has arguably the hardest early game fight, with Father Gascoine, not to mention an amazing piece of world design is showed off around a half dozen hours later, when after a long trek through a snake infested forest leads to a long ladder that takes you straight back to Central Yharnam.</p>
        1. Seyda Neen/Ascadian Isles - Morrowind<br>

            <p>The marshes of the Ascadian Isles region is colourful, strange, and deadly if you stray too far off the path. If you equip yourself properly in the starting town, you can get some very powerful, very expensive items early on.</p>
        2. Prologue - Call of Duty Modern Warfare<br>
            <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ariUfjw9dp4/maxresdefault.jpg">
            <p>The tanker level takes you right into what's best about the first Modern Warfare game. Action, yet not lacking sutblety. Setpieces galore, yet you can stealth through the level. It's everything good about the first chapter in the downfall of the series.</p>
        3. E1M1 - DOOM<br>
            <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c9cWavUoJWM/maxresdefault.jpg">
            <p>E1M1 was constructed as the first level of DOOM after the rest of the game was made, and it shows. Any experience gained by the developers during the project shines, and every feature of the game is in it. It has countless secrets, jokes, and brutal destruction. </p>
        4. Running Interference - Thief 2<br>
            <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S6hcg3VB3y8/maxresdefault.jpg">
            <p>In the first level of the titular stealth game, Garrett is tasked with the rescue of his fence's spouse. Along the way, he figures he can take anything he pleases, and he does. A massive mansion full of loot that is fun to explore, Running Interference capitalizes on what makes the Thief games fun.</p>
